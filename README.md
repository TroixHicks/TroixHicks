🤟🏾 Hello, I'm Troi Hicks!







![hello](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88952205/133462705-a38a0319-83ef-48e2-b2aa-3abdd743cfdc.gif)

              
   
    I am currently a full stack developer based in the Philadelphia, PA area. 
    I have experience building fully responsive and accessible web applications.       
    👽 I’m interested in creating and learning about technology that centers, helps, and 
    supports marginalized communities. As a software engineer at Resilient Coders, 
    I hope to merge technology and art that centers dispossessed communities and elevates those communities 
    through the use of storytelling and visual expression.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS
