🤟🏾 Hello, I'm Troi Hicks!
              
   
    I am currently a full stack developer based in the Philadelphia, PA area. I have experience building fully responsive and accessible web applications.       
    👽 I’m interested in creating and learning about technology that centers, helps, and supports marginalized communities.
